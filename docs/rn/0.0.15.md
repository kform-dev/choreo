# Release 0.0.15

[ChangeLog](https://github.com/kform-dev/choreo/releases)

## Reworked the cmd flags and behavior

- apply now has a stream capabilitiy
- flags are organized per command

## Result format

When you run choreoctl run once the output format can be specified

- options: 
    - reconciler
    - resource
    - raw
- default: reconciler
- other:
    - resource: outputs the result data per resource with operation summary
    - raw: outputs the raw result data

## choreo project structure

- libraries are loaded from the crds directory and the respective langiage file extensions
- reconcilers use a hierarchical structure: a directory where:
    - a config.yaml is located
    - all reconciler files are located in that directory


### hierarchical loading

1. load the upstream ref in a hierarchical way
    -> we create child choreo instances

we allow for :
- root -> childroot (crd/reconcilers/data) -> childcrd
- root -> childcrd (crd/lib)
- root -> data/reconcilers/libs/crds

example kubenet
+- childroot1 topologyref priority 10
  +- childinstance (crd)
  +- childinstance (crd)
  +- reconcilers
  +- data (templates)
+- reconcilers
+- in
+- refs

sequence
- init apis globally (we assume no api overlap right now or inconsistencies)
- libraries are loaded and stored per rootinstance or childrootinstance
- reconcilers are loaded and stored per rootinstance or childrootinstance
- data is loaded globally to the root instance api server
- run garbage collection

2. Running

we run the instances in hierarchy in the once mode

## config diff

using the -s flag we allow schema validation and config generation once the reconcilers ran successfully.

## run once streamer

changed run once to a streaming service such that updates from the runner can be conveyed to the user.
